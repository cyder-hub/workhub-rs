# Support Matrix

This matrix is the Stage 8 release support reference for the Rust MCP Atlassian server. It is based on the current Rust registry, the Python 73-business-tool baseline, and the Stage 5 real acceptance record.

## Status Terms

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Implemented | Exposed by the Rust MCP server with registry metadata, schema, handler, service filtering, toolset filtering, enabled-tool filtering, and read-only guard behavior where applicable. |
| Local/MCP covered | Covered by local mock REST tests, MCP discovery/call tests, smoke tests, or read-only/filtering tests. |
| Real accepted | Stage 5 executed the path against real Atlassian test services. For writes, this only means real write execution when the note explicitly says so. |
| Local only | Implemented and locally validated, but Stage 5 did not execute a dedicated real acceptance row. |
| Read-only guard only | Stage 5 validated that real MCP/read-only mode blocks the destructive write; the destructive operation itself was not executed on a real object. |
| Product blocked | Implemented locally, but Stage 5 was blocked by product availability, permission, or interface behavior in the test tenant. |
| Cloud only | Supported for Atlassian Cloud; Server/Data Center returns a structured unavailable response where documented. |

## Tool Count Summary

| Service | Python baseline | Rust business tools | Release status |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Jira | 49 | 49 | Implemented |
| Confluence | 24 | 24 | Implemented |
| Total Atlassian business tools | 73 | 73 | Implemented |
| Migration utility | Not part of parity | 0 exposed | No migration utility tool is exposed in the production MCP tool surface. |

## Stage 5 Acceptance Boundaries

| Area | Current release status | Unblock condition for stronger claim |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Jira Service Management | Product/permission blocked. Stage 5 service desk lookup returned 403, so `jira_service_desk` is not real-accepted. | Run acceptance in a tenant/project where the test identity can resolve a service desk and queue, then record real service desk, queue, and queue issue reads. |
| Jira Forms/ProForma | Product/interface blocked. Stage 5 did not receive an effective Forms API response and did not have a valid real form ID for details/update. | Run acceptance in a tenant with Jira Forms/ProForma enabled, a test issue with a form, and a safe test answer update target. |
| Confluence user search | Local only for `confluence_search_user`. Stage 5 did not execute a dedicated real user-search row. | Add and run a dedicated real Confluence user-search acceptance row with a non-sensitive test query and expected account result shape. |
| Confluence destructive writes | Read-only guard only for `confluence_delete_page`, `confluence_move_page`, and `confluence_delete_attachment`. Stage 5 did not delete, move, or delete an attachment on a real object. | Run destructive acceptance only against disposable test pages/attachments with cleanup and explicit object isolation. |

## Runtime Configuration

| Capability | Env or CLI surface | Rust status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Read-only mode | `READ_ONLY_MODE` | Supported | Truthy values hide write tools from discovery and block direct write calls. |
| Exact tool allowlist | `ENABLED_TOOLS` | Supported | Comma-separated MCP tool names. Empty or unset means no name filtering. |
| Toolset filtering | `TOOLSETS` | Supported | Supports `all`, `default`, and comma-separated registered toolsets. Unknown-only values fail closed. |
| Streamable HTTP binding | `MCP_HTTP_HOST`, `MCP_HTTP_PORT`, `MCP_HTTP_PATH`, `streamhttp --host/--port/--path` | Supported | Default MCP path is `/mcp`; missing leading slash is normalized. |
| Health endpoint | `GET /healthz` | Supported | Available for streamable HTTP deployments and compose healthchecks. |
| Request-scoped auth bypass | `IGNORE_HEADER_AUTH` | Supported | Truthy values ignore request-scoped auth/service headers and use only global environment config. |
| Header URL allowlist | `MCP_ALLOWED_URL_DOMAINS` | Supported | Restricts header-provided Jira/Confluence service URLs to exact domains or subdomains. |
| Global Cloud ID | `ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_CLOUD_ID` | Supported | Used by Cloud BYOT auth and request-scoped Bearer disambiguation. |
| Bearer BYOT switch | `ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_ENABLE` | Supported | Truthy values interpret streamable HTTP `Authorization: Bearer` as BYOT/OAuth access-token auth. |

## Authentication

| Request-scoped Basic auth | `Authorization: Basic <base64(email:api_token)>` | Supported | Streamable HTTP only; scoped to the request/session. |
| Request-scoped Token auth | `Authorization: Token <pat>` | Supported | Streamable HTTP only; PAT-compatible token auth. |
| Request-scoped Bearer PAT-compatible auth | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Supported | Used when no BYOT signal is present. |
| Request-scoped Bearer BYOT auth | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` plus `X-Atlassian-Cloud-Id` or `ATLASSIAN_OAUTH_ENABLE=true` | Supported | Uses BYOT/OAuth access-token semantics and token-type-aware session fingerprinting. |
| Request-scoped service URL/PAT headers | `X-Atlassian-Jira-Url`, `X-Atlassian-Jira-Personal-Token`, `X-Atlassian-Confluence-Url`, `X-Atlassian-Confluence-Personal-Token` | Supported | Header-provided URLs are validated by the Stage 6 SSRF boundary. |
| Request-scoped Cloud ID | `X-Atlassian-Cloud-Id` | Supported | Also disambiguates Bearer as BYOT access-token auth. |
| OAuth Cloud 3LO authorization-code flow | OAuth app flow | Not supported in the current Rust release | Fixed backlog item; not implemented by Stage 8. |

| Data Center OAuth authorization-code/refresh | Data Center OAuth app flow | Not supported in the current Rust release | Fixed backlog item; PAT and BYOT fallback are supported instead. |

## Transport

| Capability | Surface | Rust status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| stdio transport | `mcp-atlassian-rs stdio` | Supported | Logs go to stderr; stdout remains MCP protocol-only. |
| Streamable HTTP transport | `mcp-atlassian-rs streamhttp` | Supported | Default endpoint is `/mcp`; path is configurable. |
| Streamable HTTP request auth | HTTP headers listed above | Supported | Request-scoped auth applies only to the current request/session and preserves service/tool filtering. |
| Health check | `GET /healthz` | Supported | Returns a simple status response for HTTP deployments. |
| SSE transport | SSE server mode | Not supported in the current Rust release | Fixed unsupported/backlog item; supported transports are stdio and streamable HTTP. |

| Confluence HTTP/HTTPS proxy | `CONFLUENCE_HTTP_PROXY`, `CONFLUENCE_HTTPS_PROXY`, `CONFLUENCE_NO_PROXY` | Supported | Service-specific values take precedence over global proxy fallback. |
| Global HTTP/HTTPS proxy fallback | `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` | Supported | Used when service-specific proxy variables are unset. |
| SOCKS proxy | `JIRA_SOCKS_PROXY`, `CONFLUENCE_SOCKS_PROXY`, `SOCKS_PROXY` | Not supported in the current Rust release | Setting these envs returns a configuration error. |
| Jira custom outbound headers | `JIRA_CUSTOM_HEADERS` | Supported | Validated comma-separated `Name=value` pairs. Reserved auth, cookie, proxy, host, content, connection, and request-scoped Atlassian headers are rejected. |
| Confluence custom outbound headers | `CONFLUENCE_CUSTOM_HEADERS` | Supported | Same validation policy as Jira custom headers. |
| Jira mTLS client cert/key | `JIRA_CLIENT_CERT`, `JIRA_CLIENT_KEY` | Supported | PEM certificate and key paths; both must be set together. |

| Outbound redirect policy | Atlassian HTTP client behavior | Supported | Redirects are same-origin only and limited to 3 hops. |
| Session auth fingerprint | `Mcp-Session-Id` with auth fingerprint | Supported | Changing auth or token type within a streamable HTTP MCP session is rejected. |
| Redaction | Logs, debug output, compact errors, env/config/error text | Supported | Redacts auth fragments, access tokens, proxy credentials, custom header values, sensitive headers, query values, and Atlassian error summaries. |

## Release And Deployment
